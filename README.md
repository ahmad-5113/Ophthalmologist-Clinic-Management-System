The Ophthalmology Clinic Management System is a database-driven application designed to enhance the efficiency of operations within an eye clinic. The system is built for two key stakeholders: Ophthalmologists and Patients. Ophthalmologists can use the platform to manage appointments, maintain patient records, track treatment history, and issue prescriptions. Patients can register, manage their accounts, book appointments, view their medical history, and provide feedback. The goal of this project is to create a digital solution that ensures organized data management, seamless communication, and convenient access to healthcare services.
